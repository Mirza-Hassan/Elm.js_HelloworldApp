# Elm.js 

It is a functional programming language for front-end web development.

Pros:
- Strong typing
- Immutable data
- Structured architecture
- Simplicity
- Good tooling

Cons:
- Learning curve
- Smaller community
- Limited libraries
- Compilation overhead
- Not suitable for all projects

# Elm Architecture

- Elm Architecture: A pattern for building interactive programs like webapps and games.
- Natural Emergence: Discovered organically by early Elm programmers.
- Widely Applicable: Useful in any front-end project, influencing patterns like Redux.
- Learning Value: Valuable even if not using Elm in a professional setting.

Basic Pattern:

# Installation

Install Elm on your system by following these steps:

1. Install Node.js: Elm requires Node.js and the Node Package Manager (npm) to run. 
2. Install Elm using npm:
```
npm install -g elm
```
Verify Installation:
```
elm --version
```
# Project Setup

To create a minimal Elm project, follow these simplified steps:

## 1. Install Elm:

Install Elm following the instructions on the official website.

## 2. Initialize Project:

In your project directory, run:

```elm init```

## 3. Create Elm File:

Create your Elm source file, e.g., Main.elm in the src directory.

## 4. Compile Elm Code:

Compile your Elm code with:

```elm make src/Main.elm --output=elm.js```

## 5. Create an HTML File:

Create an HTML file  ```index.html``` and include the generated elm.js.

## 6. Run Your Elm Application:

Open the HTML file in a web browser to run your Elm app.

## 7. Serve Your Elm Application

To serve your Elm application using an HTTP server

```npm install -g http-server```

  Run a local HTTP server using ```http-server```

  View Your Elm Application ```http://localhost:8081```

These steps provide a concise guide to set up a minimal Elm project.
